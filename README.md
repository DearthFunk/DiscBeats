# DiscBeats
Live Demo: <a href="http://dearthfunk.github.io/DiscBeats/">http://dearthfunk.github.io/DiscBeats/</a><br><br>

Simply put, it is a disc with multiple layers. Each layer is track with a different audio sample. Click a slice of the disc to activate the cell. Basically its a drum tracker, but in the shape of a disc. <br><br>


## SETUP ##
1) clone the repo<br>
2) you will need a virtual server installed or the ability to run the repo locally. personally I use https://github.com/indexzero/http-server. Basically, you install npm, then use the command npm install http-server -g to install it, then use the command http-server to run you virtual server. <br>
3) once you havea virtual web server installed/running (if using the above example, visit http://localhost:8080), simply launch the index.html file or the root directory<br>
4) the right side of the window will have your menu where you can change all settings.<br>
